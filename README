Xfce 4.12 SlackBuilds tested on Slackware 15.0 beta.

NOTE! I am testing these still! Use at your own risk!

Reasoning:
I want to keep using a GTK2-based desktop environment on Slackware 15,
therefore I decided to stay with Xfce 4.12. The scripts here follow the
SBo style, but I used the Xfce SlackBuilds from Slackware 14.2 and SBo,
as a starting point. There are a few version differences, whenever a
minor update was available, as well as, several new patches.

Folder contents:
xfce/		The core components of the Xfce desktop.
plugins/	Plugins for thunar and the panel.
apps/		Additional applications that complement Xfce.
borrowed/	Dependencies that are available at SBo. Install them
		from there to avoid "overlapping" packages.
art/		The old Xfwm themes and Xfce GTK2 engines and the GNOME
		icon theme (Tango still uses it as a fallback).

Simple dependencies information is provided in the *.info files, however
there is a build queue (tales.sqf) that can be loaded by sbopkg.

Packages are built in /tmp/SBo, however, they are tagged as "_tales".

Of course, you should not install anything from the "XFCE" series.
