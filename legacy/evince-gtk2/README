Evince is a document viewer for multiple document formats. It currently 
supports pdf, postscript, djvu, tiff and dvi. The goal of evince is to

with a single simple application.

Evince is specifically designed to support the following file formats:
* PDF
* Postscript
* DjVu
* TIFF
* CBR/CBZ (comic books)
* DVI (requires optional dependency texlive)
* XPS (requires optional dependency libgxps)
