This is the last GTK2 version of Brasero and it will conflict with the
one on SBo!

Brasero is a application to burn CD/DVD for the Gnome Desktop. It is 
designed to be as simple as possible and has some unique features to 
enable users to create their discs easily and quickly.

libburn and libisofs are optional dependencies, and they will be
used if they are installed.
